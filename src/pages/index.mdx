<h1 className="sm:text-5xl">Hi, I'm Zachary.</h1>

I'm a software craftsman with 20+ years' experience living in Atlanta,&nbsp;GA.

I craft digital experiences that are usually, but not always, on the Web and use modern
tools with an emphasis on tool-building and efficiency.

**I'm also:**

- A husband to a wonderful woman.
- A dad to handsome twins.
- A proud person with Autism.

You can find me around the Internet in various places, such as
