title: 'About Zachary'
---

I'm Zachary Jones. For the majority of my life I have been obsessed with and actively developing
software: literally from age seven. The majority of my software engineering experience has been
around the Web as I was beginning to use computers in the mid-1990s and the Web was new and exciting
then and nascent enough to seem graspable even for an elementary school kid. In retrospect, this was
probably not a common thought for a typical child.
