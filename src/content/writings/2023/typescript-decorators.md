## Overview

[TypeScript 5.0][1] introduces support for [ECMAScript Decorators][2], which are an upcoming feature
but which have existed in draft form for many years. For several major versions of TypeScript there
has been support for "experimental" decorators through a `--experimentalDecorators` flag and
`tsconfig.json` setting. It was not enabled by default but was required to use decorators in
TypeScript code that utilized them idiomatically (for example, [Nest.js][3])
