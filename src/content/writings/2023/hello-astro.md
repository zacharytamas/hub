This is my first blog post on my new website that I've built using [Astro 2.0](https://astro.build).
I am still figuring out how I feel about it.

My first impressions are very good. For a static site generator I am pretty excited about it. The
fact that it can render and use so many other libraries' components is pretty amazing. I am most
familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and would probably use those the most but on a technical
level it's impressive that it supports those other libraries with essentially the same UX.

I build a lot of dynamic web applications with React and it's clear that Astro is not intended for
that type of thing: it is more of a web*site* builder and not a web*app* builder. Because of that it
seems immediately _limiting_ because I could use the same tools that I use for things like, such as
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), that for static sites as well.

However, Astro's speed and simplicity despite being so sophisticated is pretty compelling. I also am
really impressed by the
[Content Collections](https://astro.build/blog/introducing-content-collections/) functionality in
Astro 2.0. This makes it really easy to use a files-based approach for storing content but also
makes it easy to keep the frontmatter and such consistent across them. I have quite a few ideas of
how to use this effectively.
