In the recent rebuild of this website, and indeed my entire online presence, I decided to
just start from scratch. This primarily means that I'm not going to import any of my old
content into the website: a lot of it was not highly representative of my current
interests, opinions, or skills anyway.

From this point on (10th September 2020), I will be starting completely fresh with my
public professional identity.
